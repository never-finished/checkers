checkers
========

A Checkers game using Python Tkinter. The pieces on the board are placed vertically to better facilitate two-player mode. 

I"d like to see if I can debug this some and refactor it to make the code a littler clearer. Some idease would be using two for loops to build the board and set initial placement of the peices. 

There do appear to be some issues with multijumps and also a player can keep moving the same peice repeatedly.
