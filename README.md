Checkers
========

A Checkers game using Python Tkinter. The pieces on the board are placed vertically to better facilitate two-player mode. 

Iâ€™d like to see if I can debug this some and refactor it to make the code a littler clearer. Some ideas would be using two for loops to build the board and set initial placement of the pieces. 

There do appear to be some issues with multi-jumps and also a player can keep moving the same piece repeatedly.
